                    Usually, if a potential client is reaching out to you, they
                    already know what they need from you. Or, at least, they
                    think they know what they need from you. You’ll listen to
                    that, take it into consideration, and supplement it with a
                    conversational series of questions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What do we mean by “conversational”? Just keep it cool and
                    caj. Try to find that sweet spot between “interrogation” and
                    “five-year-old who just wants to know why why why?” and work
                    your magic from there.

                      Clients don’t always think about the return on their
                      investment in terms of percentages. Sometimes they just
                      guess the price based on what number “feels comfortable”
                      for them. And that’s okay. But that’s not where the
                      conversation ends.

                    <p>
                      Demonstrate what percentage they’re offering to pay you.
                      If the revenue increase is estimated to be $480k and the
                      client is only willing to spend $10k, they are offering
                      just 2.5%. Spelling it out like that might just be enough
                      to get you back in the game.
